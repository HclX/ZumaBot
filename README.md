# ZumaBot
A Zuma game playing bot.

This is a toy created when my son kept asking me playing Zuma. Without large chunk of time learning all advanced image recognition  libraries, i prototyped with python and finished with C# using just some basic image recognition techniques and make this barely work. It's still far from a perfect game playing bot yet but i was able to watch it going all the way to stage 8.

To run it, you will need to have Zuma Deluxe installed somewhere on your computer. Since mine is a localized version, the code is detecting Zuma window by searching a chinese window title. This should be improved later for better compatibility.
